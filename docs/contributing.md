# Thinking of contributing?

First off: heck yes! You're a superhero already, thank you so much!

But there's a bit of "legalese" we need to cover, because this might be the first open source project you're thinking of contributing to, and there's some "ego stripping" involved:

- If you want to contribute code to this repository, you _will_ be acknowledge as a contributor, in the CONTRIBUTORS.md file

That doesn't sound too bad, but here's the flip side:

- Any docs you write will not be attributed to you
- Any code you contribute will not be attributed to you

Instead, your contributions become part of the codebase, and if people really want to know what specific thing you contributed, they can look at the git commit log, but you will not be credited for any specific thing, nor will you hold a copyright or any sort of ownership over the part(s) you contributed.

If that's fine: amazing, let's get your stuff in there! If not: that's fine too, but I need you to be aware that you will not profit from this, and you will not be able to pull any strings in this codebase just because you contributed something. This isn't a vanity project, or a CV-padding opportunity: any code or docs you contribute should make other people's lives better, not put you in a position of power.

## Okay so what about you? Why would you benefit from my work?

I don't. This project does. You wrote something that helps you use this project, and as a nifty side effect, that something helps others, too. Welcome to Open Source: adding what we want is pretty selfish, but by relinquishing control over those changes, what we want ends up helping loads of other folks, too. It's why companies pay engineers to work on open source, and why billion dollar valuable companies sponsor open source. They can get what they want, and the fact that it helps others is just a side effect.

A _most excellent_ side effect.
