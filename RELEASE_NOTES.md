# Release notes

## version 1.1

This release has no public-facing changes, and is instead a refactor of the client-side code that handles creating and toggling editors for files, allowing for easier future development, and paying off tech debt.

## verion 1.0

This was an untagged release. All platform changes in this and older versions are commit based, rather than being versioned.
