# Release notes

## version 1.3

Users can now reorder tabs in the editor, allowing in-browser ordering to match "best for work" ordering without having to open files in a specific order.

This release also includes CSP descriptor fixes that prevented some aspects of the editor from loading in Chrome, and a CSS tweak to make it visually obvious that a project is being loaded, even if it takes a while to bootstrap the associated container.

## version 1.2

The file tree can be persistently collapsed, allowing users to "queue up" the files they want to work on, and then slide the column divider for the file tree all the way to the left, hiding the file tree. Toggling between files using the tab navigation will leave the file tree collapsed, allowing for a "calmer" editor experience.

This release also fixes a typo in the basic html starter project.

## version 1.1

This release has no public-facing changes, and is instead a refactor of the client-side code that handles creating and toggling editors for files, allowing for easier future development, and paying off tech debt.

## verion 1.0

This was an untagged release. All platform changes in this and older versions are commit based, rather than being versioned.
