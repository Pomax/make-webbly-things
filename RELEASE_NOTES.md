# Release notes

## version 1.2

The file tree can be persistently collapsed, allowing users to "queue up" the files they want to work on, and then slide the column divider for the file tree all the way to the left, hiding the file tree. Toggling between files using the tab navigation will leave the file tree collapsed, allowing for a "calmer" editor experience.

This release also fixes a typo in the basic html starter project.

## version 1.1

This release has no public-facing changes, and is instead a refactor of the client-side code that handles creating and toggling editors for files, allowing for easier future development, and paying off tech debt.

## verion 1.0

This was an untagged release. All platform changes in this and older versions are commit based, rather than being versioned.
