  <h1>Loading<span>.</span><span>.</span><span>.</span> hang tight!</h1>

  <p>
    This project wasn't already running, so it can take a few seconds for it to
    fully start up (because it's starting up an entire operating system!)
  </p>

  <p>
    If after about 10 seconds the project still hasn't loaded, something's
    probably gone wrong and there might be a problem with the project's
    bootstrap or startup scripts.
