    <h1>This is a basic Node.js server.</h1>
    <p>You can do a lot with this!</p>

    <p>
      The base image gives you both Node and Python (because some Node
      dependencies require Python for compilation...), so you get Node {{ node
      }} and {{ python }} to work with.
    </p>

    <p>
      You may be a little scared of that giant "node_modules" folder on the
      left: those are all the things this Node project relies on, and we
      basically don't care about what's in that folder: simply click the folder
      icon to the left of "node_modules" to collapse the folder, and suddenly
      the project will look a lot more manageable =)
    </p>

    <p>
      (Although if you want to browse the dependency content, or even change
      what they do, you can: it's your project, dig in!)
