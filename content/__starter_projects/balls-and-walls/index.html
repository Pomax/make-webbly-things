    <p>
      This is an example of a basic interactive graphic: some balls, some walls,
      and some <s>falls</s> collisions:
    </p>

    <main>
      <graphics-element
        id="graphics"
        title="Shoot some balls!"
        src="./sketches/my-sketch.js"
        safemode
      >
        <source src="./sketches/Ball.js" />
        <source src="./sketches/Line.js" />
        <source src="./sketches/physics.js" />
      </graphics-element>
    </main> 

    <p>
      You control the biggest ball, and you can shoot it in the direction of
      wherever you click/tap in the graphic. The further away from the ball you
      click/tap, the faster it'll go.
    </p>

    <p>
      You may also notice that the balls bounce against walls "at their centers"
      rather than at their edges, and sometimes, if things are moving
      <em>real</em> fast, balls seem to be able to just... "go through each
      other", and sometimes even <em>through walls</em>???
    </p>

    <p>
      Think you can fix that? Hit up the code in the
      <code>sketches</code> folder on the left and start reading
      <code>my-sketch.js</code> to see if you can figure out where things start
      going wrong, and why.
