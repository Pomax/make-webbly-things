# It's an eleventy blog!

This is a blog starter project you can remix to make your very own. 📰🌎🛼

## Get to know your blog 👀

* The posts are in the `posts` folder
  * Each one has some **frontmatter** for metadata followed by the content
* The page **HTML** structure is defined in the `_layouts` folder
* The appearance is defined in `style.css`
* The `package.json` and `.eleventy.js` files combine with the project settings to build and run the blog!

## Edit your new blog 🧰

* Make a change to the content in `index.md` and watch the preview update
* Change a color in `style.css`
* Edit the HTML in a `_layouts` file

## Make a new post ✏️

* Click the little button next to the `posts` folder to add a new file
* Name your file something ending `.md` like `news.md`
* At the top enter some frontmatter like this:

```
---
title: Some news
description: This is some news I have
date: 2025-09-05
tags:
  - posts
layout: post.njk
---
```

The template is in the `_layouts` folder and uses [Nunjucks](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/languages/nunjucks/) to build your blog data into the pages.

* After this add some content and try opening your new post in the preview!

**Share your blog with your friends..!** 📣
