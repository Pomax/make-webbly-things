Use the setup script to create the Caddyfile. If you need to debug Caddy's behaviour, open the Caddyfile and uncomment the `debug` statement up top. The code will automatically see that you're trying to debug and will run caddy with stdio Remember to recomment it when you're done =)

You can customize the response templates in the `html` folder to suit your needs.
